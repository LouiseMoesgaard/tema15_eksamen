    "Hollaback Lager": "We still don’t understand what Gwen Stefani means by “Hollaback girl” but our “Hollaback Lager” is a nice lager and has actually nothing to do with the song. Because we ain’t no hollaback giiiirl!",
    "Steampunk": "This beer has nothing to do with Steam nor punk, not even the genre it is named after. But after drinking a lot of these you will feel like you are in Wild Wild West riding in that big spider machine alongside Will Smith!",
    "GitHop": "If Git gives you too many merge conflicts, then wash away the pain with our GitHop! Venom ale sounds lethal… Well, you only live once, right?",
    "Fairy Tale Ale": "If you drink this enough, you might see Tinkerbell. But please, do not try to fly off of the roof to go to Neverland, we do not pay for the injuries.",
    "El Hefe": "After drinking some of these, you might start to speak Spanish like the name of this beer. “El Hefe” is a nice wheat beer that has absolutely nothing to do with Spanish culture besides the pun.",
    "Hoppily Ever After": "Because we do not believe in happily ever after. You will find true happiness in this beer - if you drink it enough, that is!",
    "Mowintime": "Backyard pilsner – whatever that is – fit for washing away the daily chores! Forget the upcoming Monday and drink our “Mowintime”!",
    "Row 26": "Our “Row 26” – whatever that means – is our greatest stout beer, and if you drink enough of it you might understand its name, and if you do… Can you please tell us?",
    "Ruined Childhood": "Let us forget about childhood trauma and wash it away with the fitting “Ruined Childhood”! Celebrate life and be thankful for a nice beer like this one!",
    "Sleighride": "You might want to go for a ride in the snow after a few of these, however, due to global warming there might not be any snow… What a bummer, but jolly spirits are a guarantee! "
